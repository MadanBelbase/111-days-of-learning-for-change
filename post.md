Today, I enhanced the UI of my blogging website by refining the individual blog detail page. I implemented the layout for the Like, Comment, and Share features to improve user interaction. This included:
✅ Structuring the interaction section using React with TypeScript
 ✅ Designing a clean and responsive layout with custom CSS
 ✅ Adding clipboard-based sharing functionality
 ✅ Preparing the interface for dynamic comment and like handling via the backend
