Today I worked on improving authentication and personalization in my blog project! 🔐📝

 Key takeaways:

Learned how to protect backend routes using a custom verifyToken middleware.
Understood how JWT works and how to decode the token to access userId securely.
Integrated author details in the blog schema and displayed the author’s name with each blog.
Built a secure profile page that shows logged-in user info, blog count, and a list of their blogs. 🙌

This hands-on work helped me clearly understand how JWT authentication, middleware, and protected routes connect the backend and frontend securely.
