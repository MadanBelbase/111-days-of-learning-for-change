Today, I worked on improving a React Navbar component.
I learned how to:
✅ Properly structure a functional component in React
✅ Use react-router-dom for navigation with <Link>
✅ Build both static and dynamic navigation bars
✅ Safely load user data from localStorage and handle logout
✅ Handle JSX syntax and import issues like missing return or wrong useEffect usage
This practice helped me understand real-world component structures and how authentication states affect UI rendering.
